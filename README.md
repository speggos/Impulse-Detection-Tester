# Peak-Detection-Tester
Program to run all .wav in a directory through one or more impulse detection algorithms.

A impulse detection algorithm is a routine that takes as input an array of signed doubles corresponding to the magnitude of a sound signal, and outputs whether or not it detected an impulse (sudden increase in volume, with a corresponding and steady decline) was detected.

## Usage
Create a folder called 'samples' in the same directory as main.js. Fill it with .wav files.
